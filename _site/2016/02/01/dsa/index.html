                              <h4>Goal</h4>
                              <p><p>In 2014, Syracuse Unversity began rethinking their branding and web standards in terms of how to portray the University in the modern world. With a focus on modernizing and meeting <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/' target='_blank'>WCAG 2.0 AA accessbility standards</a>, the University produced <a href='http://styleguide.syr.edu' target='_blank'>interim branding guidelines</a> for all divisions and departments to follow while they were working on the comprehesive guidelines.</p>
<p>As the Web Specialist, in charge of all 26 departments in the Division of Student Affairs, my job was to take the branding guidelines and modify a pre-existing site design to fit our content management system, <a href='https://www.hannonhill.com/' target='_blank'>Cascade</a>. <strong>My main goals were to upgrade the layout of our departmental sites visually, make our sites WCAG 2.0 AA compliant to meet our accessibility standard, and implement features that would make it easy for our users to update their own sites.</strong></p></p>
                          
      
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                           
                           
                              <h4>Development</h4>
                              <p> <h5>Layout</h5> <img src='../img/portfolio/dsa-layout.jpg' alt='DSA Layout difference'> <p class='small'>(Left: 2008 Layout, Right: Interim Design Layout)</p> <p>Student Affairs departmental sites had been using a layout from 2008 that was not updated at all during this timespan. Many students, staff, and faculty spoke of how cluttered and static our sites were. Within months of my start as the Web Specialist for the Division, I was able to use a pre-existing design from our regional sites and modified the layout to match our branding guidelines. The layout was modified to have a cleaner, minimalistic look, but with the ability to add more dynamic content. This layout was adapted into Cascade and distributed to our departments for usage.</p> <h5>Accessiblity</h5> <p>In 2014, a University-wide committee was created to address accessibility issues in our technology and web fronts. I was asked to participate in the sub-committee focused on web accessibility and helped in the acquistion/creation of tools to assist all departments and division in making their sites accessible.</p> <p>The knowledge and training I received in the sub-committee helped me modify the layout and code to allow for our sites to meet WCAG 2.0 AA compliance. This is a continual effort that allows to train and inform my departments about accessibility standards and how to accomodate for all types of disabilities on the web.</p> <h5>Back-End</h5> <p>After meeting with several departments and receiving feedback on Cascade, many of them expressed frustration and discussed how difficult it was to work with when updating their sites. Many departments have website managers that are not familiar with programming or design, so they felt like Cascade required too much of them to perform basic tasks such as adding a new page. One specific feedback mentioned that Cascade was difficult to use when embedding social media widgets nad profiles. Many of departments had social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc and wanted to embed them, but found it impossible to do so.</p> <p>Listening to their feedback, I decided to implement new features to make Cascade easier to work with. For instance, to address the social media issue, I created several widgets (known as modules in Cascade) where they could simply put in their username or page link, and it would generate the profile/feed widget itself. It requires no embed codes or anything like that on their part. I also was able to create an easy to use lightbox gallery and a slideshow module, which was highly requested by our departments. These features allows the departments to connect their student audience easier and showcase important information more effectively.</p> </p>

The team was presented with specific branding guidelines from Cornell and EL+R which gave me several ideas on how to rework their website. They also came to us with their own wireframes to adapt onto their website. From there, I was able to create new wireframes with an unique iteration of their website</p></p>

Additionally, I distributed color to different parts of layout to focus on specific areas of content. My number one priority was to make this design unique, but still user-friendly for all types of viewers. Once the design mockups were finished, the new layout was presented and they were happy with their redesigned look.</p></p>

As a fun side project, I wanted to create a mobile application for convention-goers to have information updated in real time during the convention.</p></p>

Lastly, <strong>the Parent</strong> is an adult who is supervising a child attending the convention. From there, I was able to create <a href='https://app.xtensio.com/folio/h70l75u' target='_blank'><strong>User Personas</strong></a> to break down what information was most important for those audiences to have and a <strong>User Flow</strong> to visualize how the target audience would interact with the app.</p> <img src='../img/portfolio/tm-userflow.jpg' alt='Tora-Con Mobile User Flow'></p>

                              <p><p>With a better understanding of the target audience, I moved onto the design phase.

Since this was my first time designing a user interface, I wanted to thoroughly research my audience so I could create the most friendly and intuitive interface.</p><p>First, I researched design patterns for both desktop and mobile applications similar to mine. Second, I created <strong>User Empathy Maps</strong> to understand how a basic user interacts with different interfaces and what their expectations of my app would be.

I decided to make the brand catered specifically to my Japanese audience, but still friendly to an English-speaking audience. In some Toei shows, particularly their superhero shows, their characters say the phrase <strong>Henshin (変身)</strong> before they transform into their superhero outfit. These shows are known for that phrase, so I wanted to integrate it into the brand.</p><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-logo-full.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Logo'><p>The logo uses the kanji of Henshin and encases it in a Japanese red circle. This logo caters to the Japanese audience for its kanji usage, but is still understandable to English audiences because of its resemblence to the Japanese flag.</p></p>

Before touching any computer programs, I started by sketching my layout ideas. I primarily sketched the desktop UI with the idea of being <strong>responsive and fluid</strong>. From there, I moved onto wireframing each page template in my layout to figure out how each element would work. The Wireframes helped me understand what elements worked and what wouldn't work for my target audience. Lastly, I designed quick mockups in Photoshop to help me visualize a consistent interface.</p></p>

Keeping in the mind that my end result was a prototype, I developed only the necessary parts of the interface. The interface is designed in full and the main three pages (Shows, Movies, and Schedule) work, but many secondary pages and links do not work. Each page features specific functionality using Javascript and jQuery to show how a user would interact with the site and what they expect.</p> <p><a class='button button-primary' href='http://nafoster.github.io/Toei-Channel/index.html'>View Desktop UI</a></p> <p>After the desktop UI was created, I moved onto developing the mobile app UI. The app was prototyped using the Ratchet framework from Bootstrap and each element was made with considerations for mobile user interactions with video and imagery. <strong>Please note most elements do not work fully due to this prototype only using HTML and CSS</strong>.</p> <p><a class='button button-primary' href='http://nafoster.github.io/Toei-Channel-Mobile/'>View Mobile UI</a></p></p>

The content serves two types of audiences, regular con-goers and first-timers. Regular con-goers want information about what will happen at the con (panels, events, vendors) while first-timers are more concerned with how to get to the location and what is in the area (directions, parking, food).</p></p>

Since their character changes every year, they needed flexible typography that can hold up with each theme. I chose two simple san-serif type faces that would pair with 2015's theme and many other themes in the future.</p></p>

We decided to use Wordpress as the content management system of choice and I kept that in mind as a created mockups of the design. Due to the young target audience, I also made sure to keep in mind how the site would look on phones and tablets so the site would be more accessible.</p></p>
