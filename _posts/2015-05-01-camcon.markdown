goal: "<p>Camillus Con (CamCon), a local anime and nerd convention hosted in Syracuse, NY desperately needed a website to host information about vendors, panels, guests, etc and allow attendees to pre-register before the convention. They asked for an user-friendly website so they could update their own site every year with new information and theme images.</p>"

research: "<img src='../img/portfolio/camcon-sitemap.jpg' alt='Camillus Con Sitemap'><p>After meeting with the executive board of the convention, I came up with a rough sitemap to organize what content needed to be on the site. The content serves two types of audiences, regular con-goers and first-timers. Regular con-goers want information about what will happen at the con (panels, events, vendors) while first-timers are more concerned with how to get to the location and what is in the area (directions, parking, food).</p>"

branding: "<img src='../img/portfolio/camcon-branding.jpg' alt='Camillus Con Branding'><p>CamCon has run for three years in a row as of 2015 and each year they come up with a new illustrated character to base that year's theme off of. Since their character changes every year, they needed flexible typography that can hold up with each theme. I chose two simple san-serif type faces that would pair with 2015's theme and many other themes in the future.</p>"

design: "<img src='../img/portfolio/camcon-design-all.jpg' alt='Camillus Con Design'><p>The design of the site needed to stay simple and flexible so the theme and information could change every year. We decided to use Wordpress as the content management system of choice and I kept that in mind as a created mockups of the design. Due to the young target audience, I also made sure to keep in mind how the site would look on phones and tablets so the site would be more accessible.</p>"

development: "<p><strong>Currently in the development process.</strong></p>
<p>The site is still in development and will be available to the public in the near future.</p>"
