goal: "<p><a href='http://toracon.org/' target='_blank'>Tora-Con</a> is an anime convention held once a year at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY. As a fun side project, I wanted to create a mobile application for convention-goers to have information updated in real time during the convention.</p>"

research: "<a href='https://app.xtensio.com/folio/h70l75u' target='_blank'><img src='../img/portfolio/tm-userpersonas.jpg' alt='ToraCon Mobile User Personas'></a>
<p>First, I started by researching who the target audience would be and broke them down into three categories: Newbie, Veteran, and Parent. <strong>The Newbie</strong> is an independent person who has never been to Tora-Con before. <strong>The Veteran</strong> is an independent person has been to Tora-Con before and is familar with how the convention runs. Lastly, <strong>the Parent</strong> is an adult who is supervising a child attending the convention. From there, I was able to create <a href='https://app.xtensio.com/folio/h70l75u' target='_blank'><strong>User Personas</strong></a> to break down what information was most important for those audiences to have and a <strong>User Flow</strong> to visualize how the target audience would interact with the app.</p>

design: "<p>With a better understanding of the target audience, I moved onto the design phase. The design was created using existing user patterns on both iPhones and Androids utilizing side menus and tabs. Both functions are available and easy-to-use on each platform. The design also was created with Tora-Con's theme in mind and kept consistent throughout the application's user interface.</p>
<p>Below is functioning prototype of the application. Please note not all areas of the application are clickable, but the main features are present.</p>
