goal: "<p>Toei Channel is a prototype of a live-streaming/on demand application service for <a href='http://www.toei.co.jp/en/' target='_blank'>Toei Company</a>, a Japanese film and television production corporation. Toei has been in Japan since the 1970's and has a long history of showcasing productions to all types of audiences in Japan. This project was for me to explore user interface design and showcase my love for Japanese media for my Senior Capstone at Cazenovia College in 2014.</p>"

research: "<a href='../img/portfolio/moodboard-big.jpg' title='Moodboard'><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-moodboard.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Moodboard'></a> <a href='../img/portfolio/palettes-big.jpg' title='Color Palettes'><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-palettes.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Color Palettes'></a><p>I started conceptualizing my idea first by creating moodboards and color palette ideas, then I moved onto extensive user research for my primarily Japanese audience. Since this was my first time designing a user interface, I wanted to thoroughly research my audience so I could create the most friendly and intuitive interface.</p><p>First, I researched design patterns for both desktop and mobile applications similar to mine. Second, I created <strong>User Empathy Maps</strong> to understand how a basic user interacts with different interfaces and what their expectations of my app would be. Lastly, I created <strong>User Personas</strong> and wrote <strong>User Stories</strong> based my audience. Each part of this research helped me understand my audience and how to cater my interface towards them.</p>"

branding: "<a href='../img/portfolio/logo-sketches-big.jpeg' title='Logo Sketches'><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-logo-sketches.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Logo Sketches'></a> <a href='../img/portfolio/logo-concepts-big.jpg' title='Logo Concepts'><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-logo-concepts.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Logo Concepts'></a><p>Once I was satisfied with my research, I moved onto the branding stage. I decided to make the brand catered specifically to my Japanese audience, but still friendly to an English-speaking audience. In some Toei shows, particularly their superhero shows, their characters say the phrase <strong>Henshin (変身)</strong> before they transform into their superhero outfit. These shows are known for that phrase, so I wanted to integrate it into the brand.</p><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-logo-full.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Logo'><p>The logo uses the kanji of Henshin and encases it in a Japanese red circle. This logo caters to the Japanese audience for its kanji usage, but is still understandable to English audiences because of its resemblence to the Japanese flag.</p>"

design: "<a href='../img/portfolio/ui-2-big.jpeg' title='UI Sketches'><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-ui-sketches.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Wireframe'></a> <a href='../img/portfolio/wireframe-big.jpg' title='Homepage Wireframe'><img src='../img/portfolio/tc-wireframe.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Wireframe'></a><p>After the brand was created, I moved onto the design phase. Before touching any computer programs, I started by sketching my layout ideas. I primarily sketched the desktop UI with the idea of being <strong>responsive and fluid</strong>. From there, I moved onto wireframing each page template in my layout to figure out how each element would work. The Wireframes helped me understand what elements worked and what wouldn't work for my target audience. Lastly, I designed quick mockups in Photoshop to help me visualize a consistent interface.</p>"

development: "<img src='../img/portfolio/tc-design-full.jpg' alt='Toei Channel Web and Mobile View'><p>Once the mockups were created, I implemented the desktop UI. Keeping in the mind that my end result was a prototype, I developed only the necessary parts of the interface. The interface is designed in full and the main three pages (Shows, Movies, and Schedule) work, but many secondary pages and links do not work. Each page features specific functionality using Javascript and jQuery to show how a user would interact with the site and what they expect.</p>

<p>After the desktop UI was created, I moved onto developing the mobile app UI. The app was prototyped using the Ratchet framework from Bootstrap and each element was made with considerations for mobile user interactions with video and imagery. <strong>Please note most elements do not work fully due to this prototype only using HTML and CSS</strong>.</p>
